          The goal of the program is to support women to become independent so
          that they have the opportunity to support themselves or their family
          financially.

          We provide free training for women who live in poor rural households,
          to help them discover income-generating opportunities and enhance
          their living standards. 


          In addition, we will also teach them entrepreneur skill and donate the
          equipments so they can apply their new skill to generate more income
          and potentially teach other women.

      - title: First empowerment program
        content: >-
          Our first empowerment program will be done in an Islamic boarding
          school, located in a small village in Bojonegoro, East Java. There are
          20 girls (age 8-15) from low income families, live and study in this
          Islamic boarding school.


          Many girls in the area will usually get married right after finishing
          the school (aged 15-17), this makes them vulnerable to gender-based
          violence and prevent them to enter the paid labour force and gaining
          economic self-sufficiency.
